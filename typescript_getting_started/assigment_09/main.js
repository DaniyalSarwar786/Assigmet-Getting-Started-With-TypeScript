// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
var myFavoriteNumber = 7;
console.log("My favorite number is ".concat(myFavoriteNumber, ".")); // This program stores my favorite number in a variable and prints a message that reveals my favorite number.
var stripCasee = "\tMy name is Dani\n";
console.log(stripCasee.trim()); // This program stores a person’s name, and includes some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. It prints the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then it prints the name after striping the white spaces.
