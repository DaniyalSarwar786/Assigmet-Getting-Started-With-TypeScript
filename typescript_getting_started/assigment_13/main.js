// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var guestList = ["Albert Einstein", "Newton", "Nikola Tesla"];
console.log("Dear ".concat(guestList[0], ", I would like to invite you to dinner"));
console.log("Dear ".concat(guestList[1], ", I would like to invite you to dinner"));
console.log("Dear ".concat(guestList[2], ", I would like to invite you to dinner"));
