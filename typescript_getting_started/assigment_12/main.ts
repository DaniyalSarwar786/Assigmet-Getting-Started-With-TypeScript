// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let transportation: string[] = ["car", "motorcycle", "bicycle", "plane"];
console.log(`I would like to buy a Ferrari ${transportation[0]}`);
console.log(`I would like to ride on a ${transportation[1]}`);
console.log(`I would like to own a ${transportation[2]}`);
console.log(`I would like to fly a ${transportation[3]}`);
